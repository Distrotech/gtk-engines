2008-02-07  Benjamin Berg  <benjamin@sipsolutions.net>

	* engines/clearlooks/src/clearlooks_style.c:
	(clearlooks_style_draw_box):
	As the panel sets the shadow to NONE too, we do not need a special
	case for it anymore.

	Need to investigate on it.
	PS: on the previous commit I forgot (yes I forgot :P) to say
	I've reverted the menuitems to their nicer behaviour ;-)

	Set the xthickness of GtkMenu to 1px and special cased the menu item
	drawing to not draw a line on the left/right for the radius == 0
	case.
	This helps with usability, as no item is selected after opening a
	context menu, and also helps with menus that have an empty area because
	of scrolling.

Thu Aug 20 18:25:07 EDT 1998 The Rasterman <raster@redhat.com>

	  and removed lots of annoying print's, added gtkr's for each
	  theme data.. now all your rc needs to do is include these rc's.

	* Started ChangeLog.

Thu Jul 30 14:51:34 EDT 1998 The Rasterman <raster@redhat.com>
	
	* Moved all the themes to install cleanly the engine *.so's in
	  $(exec_prefix)/lib/gtk/themes/engines/ .
	  All the data for themes is now installed in 
	  $(exec_prefix)/share/gtk/themes/theme_name/
	  All things build using GNU configure and autoconf and libtool now.
	  I have created a win95, motif and pixmap theme setup - i have to
	  work on the motif and win95 ones - pixmap theme also need work - 
	  it partially parses a gtkrc for itself. This is goign to be a good
	  sample base to work from if you wish to write your own theme engines.
			  

Thu Jul 30 19:10:42 EDT 1998 The Rasterman <raster@redhat.com>

	* Fixed the win95/motif drawing functions to NOT clobber the original
	  GTK bg pixmap style stuff.... :)
