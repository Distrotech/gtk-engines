	* */*.[ch]: Removed unused code for handling
	RC data, made functions	static to reduce damage from g_module's
	RTLD_GLOBAL. Removed theme_set_background functions
	which were just cut 'n paste code from GTK+.

	* */*.h: Removed unused, obsolete header files.

	* added metal theme, fixed pixmap theme now to use pixmap path -
	  and removed lots of annoying print's, added gtkr's for each
	  theme data.. now all your rc needs to do is include these rc's.

	* Makefile.am, pixmap/Makefile.am: Switch back to using automake,
	  fix things up to make dist properly.

	* Moved all the themes to install cleanly the engine *.so's in
	  $(exec_prefix)/lib/gtk/themes/engines/ .
	  All the data for themes is now installed in 
	  $(exec_prefix)/share/gtk/themes/theme_name/
	  All things build using GNU configure and autoconf and libtool now.
	  I have created a win95, motif and pixmap theme setup - i have to
	  work on the motif and win95 ones - pixmap theme also need work - 
	  it partially parses a gtkrc for itself. This is goign to be a good
	  sample base to work from if you wish to write your own theme engines.

	* Fixed the win95/motif drawing functions to NOT clobber the original
	  GTK bg pixmap style stuff.... :)
