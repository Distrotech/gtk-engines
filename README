gtk-engines
===========

gtk-engines provides a central location for commonly used GTK+ engines. 

It currently supplies several engines and default themes for those which have one.

1.) Crux - The engine created for the once popular theme by Eazel, Inc. Unfortunately long without maintainence it is no longer as popular or considered as useable as it once was.

2.) HC - The High Contrast engine is primarily targeted at Usability Themes, such as the GNOME a11y themes HighContrast HighContrastLarge etc.

3.) Industrial - developed by Ximian, Inc. as the default apearance for its Desktop. Industrial is a highly popular look which provides a simple, consistant, and highly cohesive appearance for applications. 

4.) LighthouseBlue - Developed by Jan Rosczak out of critques by Eugenia Loli-Queru over the BlueCurve theme Copyright RedHat Inc. LightHouseBlue Engine and theme experiments with certain concepts of usability such as Bold fonts on current notebook tabs. etc.

5.) Metal - An engine and theme designed to mimic the Java Swing Metal apearance

6.) Mist - A minimalist engine designed to provide simple UI experiance.

7.) Redmond - An engine and theme designed to mimic the appearance of another OS

8.) Thinice - A once highly popular engine with thin edges and theme of Icy Colors, providing a simple mostly clean apearance many find satisfying.

9.) Smooth - An engine currently gaining in popularity for its ability to configure common theme elements with a high degree of flexibility, without sacrificing too much in terms of speed or theme footprint size.

Requirements
============

To compile this package, you must have:

 GTK+, version 2.6.0 or better

   http://www.gtk.org/
   ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/

Installation
============

 ./configure 
 make
 [ become root ]
 make install


If you configured GTK+ in a non-default prefix, you should
configure this package the same way. For instance:

 ./configure --prefix=/opt/gtk+

If you need to install this package in a different prefix
from GTK+, then you'll have to set your GTK_PATH environment
variable to point to the installed prefix. For instance,
if this package was configured with:

 ./configure --prefix=/home/john.doe/gtk-engines/

Then you'd set:

 GTK_PATH=/home/john.doe/gtk-engines/lib/gtk-2.0/
 export GTK_PATH

This will allow GTK+ to find the newly installed theme
engines. To use the default themes (installed into 
$prefix/share/themes), you'll need to copy or link them 
into your  ~/.themes directory.

If you need to skip an engine/theme (for example if installed by another package on which this should depend) configure with --disable-<engine>. 

To skip all default themes pass --disable-themes

Purpose
=======

gtk-engines exists currently to -

1.) Provide a central place to maintain usefull but otherwise unmaintained engines
2.) Provide a common point of dependency for desktop theme packages
3.) Encourage the seperation of commonly used engines from themes
4.) Provide a common way to get said engines seperate from any desktop
5.) Ensure engine dependencies are simple so themes "Just Work" for the user

It does NOT propose to always be synced with every engine maintained elsewhere, though it should be to a degree, it is instead up to package maintainers to ensure that where applicable gtk-engines depends on the latest packages of the official engines and skips included versions.
